#Tilenavr

I wrote this as a tile-based one page website. I got sick of seeing responsive sites that just used anchor tags and silly scrolling buttons to go from up to down. I'm on my phone; why can't I go left and right? So I created this. Using Touchswipe.js and some jQuery, I basically manipulate the open classes with some jQuery and use some CSS3 animations to animate them in and out. I used this for my personal portfolio.
